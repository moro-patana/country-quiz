## Overview
![screenshot](https://iili.io/qk3lPs.png)


- This project is built with react hooks and the countries are from an api.


-   You can find the demo: https://country-quiz-manjaka.netlify.app
-   When I did this project, I experienced:
  1. We can fetch the data randomly to show them one at a time.
  2. Using context is the best idea so that we can use the states from the context in another components.
-   I learned how to use random() and deal with multiple button (there are four buttons for the answer options).
